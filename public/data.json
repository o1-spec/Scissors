      "question": "How does URL shortening work?",
      "answer": "URL shortening works by taking a long URL and creating a shorter, condensed version that redirects to the original URL. It accomplishes this by assigning a unique identifier to the original URL and storing it in a database. When a user clicks on the shortened link, the service looks up the original URL associated with the identifier and redirects the user to the intended destination."
